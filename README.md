**Build your portfolio project (Week 3): Project Landing Page**

The Portfolio Project landing page is a webpage that presents information about the project without requiring the visitor to signup, login, or even use the application. It is possible that the Landing Page is also the main webpage for the project.

Site used to deploy project: Netlify
Deployment link: https://cerulean-moonbeam-6324d6.netlify.app/

**Tasks**

0. Share link to landing page and deployed app or video demo.

Share two links here:

   * Landing page URL
   * Deployed project page URL, or link to a Youtube video of a demo of the app

1. Intro section

On page load, your project is introduced with:

   * A large cover image
   * The name of your project
   * A one-line phrase and/or description of your project
   * Navigation elements in the header bar to access each section you’ve defined (please have at least 2)
   * A labeled button that navigates to the deployed project application.

2. Feature Section

Somewhere following the intro section, include a section where the landing page highlights 3 key features.

For each feature include:

   * An image, screenshot, gif, or video
   * The name of the feature
   * A description of the feature

3. About Section

Somewhere following the feature section, include an About section.

This about section needs to include:

   * A description of what inspired the project. Make this is a personal story, and not “because Holberton required this project”. It is reasonable to  include the timeline, and feel free to also mention this is a Portfolio Project for Holberton School with a link.
   * Links to each team member’s LinkedIn, github and Twitter profile.
   * A link to the github repository for the project.
